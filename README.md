# React.js Weather Application

This weather application was coded in React, utilizing Hooks, Components, and Props. Other languages used include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6, and Bootstrap for styling. The Open Weather Map API was used to pull real-time weather data and 3 hour forecasts for any given city worldwide. When a user searches for a city, the app will return the local time of that city. A Geolocation feature using the Open Weather Map API is also available. Users have the option to convert the units from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
